Altitude Type
	Circumpolar	=> 1
	RiseSet		=> 0.5
	NeverRise	=> 0

Latitudinal Range
	If -S.Lat <= LAT <= N.Lat	=> 1
	Else				=> 0

Season (DT = DateTime)
	If DT is within Constellation.SeasonTimeSpan => 1
	If DT is within +- 1 month (30 days) of the SeasonTimeSpan.Min and Max	=> 0.5
	Else	=> 0
	
LHA and Local Time
	Time of day, Longitude, RA, LHA, and LST may be used to determine whether
	the object is in the sky or even at its peak.

	Negative hour angles (-180 < dso.LHA < 0) => object is approaching the meridian
	Positive hour angles (0 < dso.LHA < 180) => object is moving away from the meridian
	An hour angle of zero means the object is on the meridian.
	An hour angle of -90 means the object has begun its ascent from the observer's horizon.
	An hour angle of 90 means the object has just finished its descent to the observer's horizon.

	The score should be higher if -90 < LHA < 90, or cos(LHA) > 0 (in the sky)
	The score should not consider when !(-90 < LHA < 90), or cos(LHA) <= 0 (not in the sky)
	An object rising should have a higher visibility score than when it is setting.
	The score should be higher when the dso's LHA is within 
		+-22.5 degrees of the meridian 			=> 1
		+-30 degrees of the meridian			=> 0.6
		+-45 degrees of the meridian			=> 0.3
	The score should be higher when the current local time of day is from 9pm to 6am.
	The score should be higher the closer the object is to the observer's zenith.
		If the object is in the sky, cos(LHA) > 0, and DEC is within
		+-22.5 degrees of the observer's latitude	=> 1
		+-30 degrees of the observer's latitude		=> 0.6
		+-45 degrees of the observer's latitude		=> 0.3

* Apparent Magnitude (Visual Brightness)
	This is relative to the apparent magnitude of the Sun (-26.74) and should be applied last.
	M = apparent magnitude of the Sun
	m = apparent magnitude of the dso
	S = current score thus far

	Use brightness factor, then relate to the range [0, 1] or as a percent

	S += {10^[0.4(m-M)] % 100} / 100
