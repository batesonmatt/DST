To Do:

- Continue work on the filters and sorting

Trajectory
- Initialize SearchListViewModel.Trajectories in the SearchController

Consider moding DST.Core.Resources to a new library.
- Add more resource definitions for the static strings used in the DST project
- Add static methods somewhere to retrieve multiple definitions in a list, such as GetTrajectoryNames() => IEnumerable<string>

SeasonModel
- Consider other methods/properties for easier work

Consider:
- initializers for GeolocationModel.TimeZoneId and .UserTimeZoneId
- initializers for SearchListViewModel properties

Consider adding custom Repositories in SearchUnitOfWork for the TimeZones and Trajectories.
- Need to have queries to retrieve the lists of TimeZones, Trajectories, and Sort fields.

- Add error page
- Revise Startup env.IsDevelopment() condition to point to and test the error page.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Plan for passing the Geolocation properties/model across controllers.
   ? - Use Session/persistant Cookies to store the values
   ? - Use TempData to transfer the values across controllers

   Might need to add a CookieExtensions class
   Might need to add more functionality to SessionExtensions class

- HttpGet Action method in SearchController to link to Track page.
- Takes Category, Id, and Geolocation (?) values for routing.
- Also add this to the Details page to link to Track page.

- Consider expanding/collapsable controls for the filter/sort lists

Update VS

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Disable geo-dependent sort/filter controls until the client either allows it, or fills in their location manually.
- Enable client-side/server-side validation for GeolocationModel and view form.
 - For any error or bad input with the geo-dependent sorting/filtering within SearchQueryOptions.SortFilter(...), just return void.
   No need to alert errors.

Implement exception handling
- All process-heavy methods, such as SearchQueryOptions.SortFilter(...)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consider using Bootstrap Cards for the list items...

See:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/#grid-cards
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/list-group/#custom-content

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consider partial view for the filters. (Lot of code)

Consider partial view for the results

Consider form for the search

Search Page (List.cshtml)
- Think about all possible items/controls that will
   be displayed in the main body.
   I can always add the filters later, or as I go.
- Remove all styles and start from scratch
- Focus only on the controls and functionality
- Get everything on this page

Fix the front-end design.
(New bootstrap version doesn't support certain things)
- For the navbar, redesign styles for navbar-toggler 
  and navbar-dark.
- refer to bootstrap version documentation

Consider changing the search page to "Browse",
and maybe a separate page/tab for searching.

Consider separate page for the results?

Consider removing _DetailsLayout.cshtml

- Add validation messages to GeoLocation properties, and any others if necessary.

- Incorporate aria, title, and name (etc.) attributes in the markups

Ideas:

For the home page, consider using a random quote of the day pulled from the database.
- These will be quotes from scifi books.
- Consider a login page (to login as admin) to CRUD these in the Quotes table.
- The login page must not be linked on the site.

___________________________________________________________

Add admin pages so that I may keep the Dso items up to date

Enable error reporting via GoDaddy email
- Add code to Services namespace
- Consider moving Services namespace up one level (out of Models)
