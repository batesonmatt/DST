To Do:

Update VS

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Linking to Track page/Controller
- HttpGet Action method in SearchController to link to Track page.
- Add link to Track page in the Details page (Do I need a Details controller?).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Redesign List view
- Add sort direction controls (Ascending and Descending)
- Add clear filters control
- Add any other necessary controls
- Consider expanding/collapsable controls for the filter/sort lists
- Consider using Bootstrap Cards for the list items
    https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/#grid-cards
    https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/list-group/#custom-content
- Consider a search bar control
- For the navbar, redesign styles for navbar-toggler and navbar-dark. (?)

Redesign Shared views

Redesign Home and About views

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Disable geo-dependent sort/filter controls until the client either allows it,
or fills in their location manually. (?)

Enable client-side/server-side validation for GeolocationModel and view form.

___________________________________________________________

For the home page, consider selecting a random object and display its info
Or perhaps a random object, and a random track or vector calculation, etc.

Incorporate aria, title, and name (etc.) attributes in the markups

Add admin pages so that I may keep the Dso items up to date (?)

Localization
- Add resource strings for the views' harcoded text.
- Once all static strings and display text have definitions in DST.Resources, 
  we need to set up the localizer service/support.
- Important:
    For display strings that are also used in route segments, be sure to send the default language value
    to the route from the view.
    Example: See the Sort.cs string properties. These are displayed, but also sent to the route dictionary.
    I can set up a test resource file with definitions for these in another language, and confirm
    that only the values from the default resource (english) are sent to the route.

Exception handling and reporting

Enable error reporting via GoDaddy email
